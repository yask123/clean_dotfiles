### Dotfiles


I recently cleaned up my dotfiles (mostly neovim, zshrc configuration), to basically start from scratch and only install bare minimum.


### Usage

1. Clone the repo in the home direcory
`git clone yask123/clean_dotfiles`

2. Create symlinks. 
`ln -s ~/clean_dotfiles ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
